## Development of the Jaspr HTML timeline

When building the timeline, you can use the `tool/hot_restart_timeline.dart` script to hot-restart the timeline.
It automatically reloads the HTML when you change any part of the Jaspr code or run the test again.

```bash
dart run hot_restart_timeline/bin/main.dart
```
