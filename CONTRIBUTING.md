# Contributing to spot

Welcome to spot!
We're thrilled that you'd like to contribute to this project.
Here are a few guidelines and tips to get you involved.

## Development of the Jaspr HTML timeline

When building the timeline, you can use the `tool/hot_restart_timeline.dart` script to hot-restart the timeline.
It automatically reloads the HTML when you change any part of the Jaspr code or run the test again.

```bash
dart run tool/hot_restart_timeline.dart
```

Optional: Set `timelineHtmlDev = true;` and the timeline will print the correct timeline paths to the console.
