Fluent, chainable Widget finders and better assertions for Flutter widget tests

‚õìÔ∏è Chainable widget selectors
üíô Prints helpful error messages

## Usage

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:spot/spot.dart';

void main() {
  testWidgets('Widget test with spot', (tester) async {
    // Create widget selectors for elements in the widget tree
    final scaffold = spot<MaterialApp>().spot<Scaffold>();
    final appBar = scaffold.spot<AppBar>();
    
    // Assert for values of widgets
    appBar.spotText('Dash').hasFontSize(14).hasFontColor(Colors.black87);
    
    // Find widgets based on child widgets
    appBar
        .spot<IconButton>(children: [spotIcon(Icons.home)])
        .existsOnce()
        .hasTooltip('home');

    // Find widgets based on multiple parent widgets
    spot<Icon>(parents: [appBar, spot<IconButton>()])
        .existsExactlyNTimes(2)
        .all((icon) {
      icon.hasColorWhere((color) => color.equals(Colors.black));
    });

    // Interact with widgets using `act`
    final button = spot<FloatingActionButton>();
    await act.tap(button);
  });
}

```

### Chain selectors

You know exactly where your widgets are. 
Like a button in the AppBar or a Text in a Dialog. 
Spot allows you to chain matchers, narrowing down the search space.

Chaining allows spot to create better error messages for you.
Spot follows the chain of your selectors and can tell you exactly where the widget is missing.
Like: `Could not find "IconButton" in "AppBar", but found these widgets instead: <AppBar-widget-tree>.`

```dart
spot<AppBar>().spot<IconButton>();
spot<IconButton>(parents: [spot<AppBar>()]);
```

Both syntax are identical. The first is shorter for when you only need a single parent.
The second allows checking for multiple parents, which is only required for rare use cases.

### Selectors

Spot has two features, creating **selectors** and asserting on them with **matchers**.

A selector is a query to find a set of widgets. 
Like a SQL query, or a CSS selector. 
It is only a description of what to search for, without actually doing the search.

Selectors can be rather complex, it is therefore recommended to **reuse** them. 
You can even save them top-level and reuse them across multiple tests.

```dart
spot<ElevatedButton>();

final MultiWidgetSelector<TextField> textFields = 
    spot<LoginScreen>().spot<LoginForm>().spot<TextField>();

final WidgetSelector<TextField> usernameTextField =
    spot<TextField>(
      parents: [
        spot<TextWithLabel>(
          children: [
            spotText('Username'),
          ],
        ),
      ],
    );
```

A `WidgetSelector` may return 0, 1 or N widgets.
Depending on how many widgets you expect to find, you should use the corresponding matchers.

### Matchers

After creating a selector, you want to assert the widgets it found. 
The `snapshot()` method creates a `WidgetSnapshot` of the widget tree at that point in time and finds all widgets that match the selector.

#### Quantity matchers

The easiest matchers are the quantity matchers. They allow checking how many widgets were found.

- `existsOnce()` asserts that exactly one widget was found
- `doesNotExist()` asserts that no widget was found
- `existsExactlyNTimes(n)` asserts that exactly `n` widgets were found
- `existsAtLeastOnce()` asserts that at least one widget was found
- `existsAtMostOnce()` asserts that at most one widget was found

```dart

final selector = spot<ElevatedButton>();

// calls snapshot() internally
final matchOne = selector.existsOnce(); 
final matchMultiple = selector.existsExactlyNTimes(5);

selector.doesNotExist(); // end, nothing to match on 
```

#### Property matchers

The property matchers allow asserting on the properties of the widgets.
You don't have to use `execpt()`, instead you can use the `has*`/`is*` matchers directly.

```dart
spot<Tooltip>()
    .existsOnce() // takes snapshot and asserts quantity
    // start your chain of matchers
    .hasMessage('Favorite')
    .hasShowDurationWhere(
      (it) => it.isGreaterOrEqual(Duration(seconds: 1000)),
    )
    .hasTriggerMode(TooltipTriggerMode.longPress);
```

To match multiple widgets use `all()` or `any()`

```dart
spot<AppBar>().spot<Tooltip>().existsAtLeastOnce()
    .all((tooltip) => tooltip
      .hasShowDurationWhere((it) => it.isGreaterOrEqual(Duration(seconds: 1000)))
      .hasTriggerMode(TooltipTriggerMode.longPress)
    );
```

### Selectors vs Matchers

It is recommended to use matchers instead of selectors once you have narrowed down the search space to the widget you want to assert on.
This makes the error messages much clearer. 
Instead of `widget not found` you'll get `Found ToolTip with message 'Settings' but expected 'Favorite'` as error message.

```dart
// DON'T
spot<Tooltip>()
    .withMessage('Favorite') // selector
    .withTriggerMode(TooltipTriggerMode.longPress) // selector
    .existsOnce();

// DO
spot<Tooltip>()
    .existsOnce()
    .hasMessage('Favorite') // matcher
    .hasTriggerMode(TooltipTriggerMode.longPress); // matcher
```

### Better errors

In case the settings icon doesn't exist you usually would get the following error using `findsOneWidget`

```
expect(find.byIcon(Icons.settings), findsOneWidget);

>>> Expected: exactly one matching node in the widget tree
>>>   Actual: _WidgetIconFinder:<zero widgets with icon "IconData(U+0E57F)" (ignoring offstage widgets)>
>>>    Which: means none were found but one was expected
```

The error message above is not really helpful, because the actual error is not that there's no icon, but the `Icons.home` instead of `Icons.settings`. 

spot prints the entire widget tree and shows that there is an `Icon`, but the wrong one (`IconData(U+0E318)`). 
That's much more helpful!

In the future, spot will only print the widget tree from the last node found node (`spot<AppBar>`).

```
spot<AppBar>().spotIcon(Icons.settings).existsOnce();

Could not find 'icon "IconData(U+0E57F)"' as child of #2 type "IconButton"
There are 1 possible parents for 'icon "IconData(U+0E57F)"' matching #2 type "IconButton". But non matched. The widget trees starting at #2 type "IconButton" are:

- ‚úÖ Interact with widgets (`act`)
- ‚úÖ Allow manually printing a screenshot at certain points
- ‚úÖ Negate child matchers
- ‚úÖ Simplify `WidgetSelector` API
- ‚¨úÔ∏è Become the de facto Widget selector API for [patrol](https://pub.dev/packages/patrol) 
- ‚¨úÔ∏è Combine multiple WidgetSelectors with `and`
- ‚¨úÔ∏è More `act` features
- ‚¨úÔ∏è Print only widget tree of the parent scope when test fails
- ‚¨úÔ∏è Create screenshot when test fails
- ‚¨úÔ∏è Automatically create report with screenshots of all user interactions
- ‚¨úÔ∏è Create interactive HTML page with all widgets and matchers when test fails

## Project state

Spot is used in production by many apps already.

The public `spot<X>()` API at this point is well-thought-out and stable.

The `act` API is waiting for more methods, but without breaking changes
